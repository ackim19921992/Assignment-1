# Example of how to use the LandCruiser class
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Create a new Land Cruiser object
    my_land_cruiser = LandCruiser(year=2020, color="Black")

 Explanation
1. Class Definition: We define a class named LandCruiser that encapsulates all attributes and methods related to this vehicle.
   
2. __init__ Method: This is the constructor method that initializes the object's attributes when a new instance is created. We set default values for brand and speed.

3. Attribute Annotations: Each attribute such as year, color, brand, and speed has a specific type and description.

4. Methods:
   - accelerate(): Increases the speed of the vehicle by a specified amount.
   - brake(): Decreases the speed but ensures that it doesn't drop below zero.
   - display_info(): Prints the current state of the vehicle, including brand, year, color, and speed.

5. Main Block: The code under if __name__ == "__main__": is an example demonstrating how to create an instance of the LandCruiser and utilize its methods.
